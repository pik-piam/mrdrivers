## Purpose and Functionality

Create GDP and population scenarios
    This package constructs the GDP and population scenarios used as drivers in both the REMIND and MAgPIE models.

<!-- The goal of **mrdrivers** is to handle the construction of GDP, GDP per capita, Population and Urban Population share scenarios: all of which are important drivers to the REMIND and MAgPIE models. -->
<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # From the PIK rse-server -->
<!-- install.packages("mrdrivers", repos = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages") -->
<!-- # or from Github -->
<!-- remotes::install_github("pik-piam/mrdrivers") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Framework

This package depends upon the
[madrat](https://github.com/pik-piam/madrat#readme) and
[magclass](https://github.com/pik-piam/magclass#readme) packages. It
integrates into the madrat framework and is structured accordingly. It
mainly uses magpie objects (from the magclass package). For more
information on madrat or magclass, please visit the respective github
repositories ([madrat](https://github.com/pik-piam/madrat#readme),
[magclass](https://github.com/pik-piam/magclass#readme)).

## Functions

The key `madrat::readSource()` and `madrat::calcOutput()` functions
provided by this package are listed below.

readSource:

    #> [1] "readSSP"       "readWDI"       "readIMF"       "readUN_PopDiv"
    #> [5] "readPEAP"

calcOutput:

    #> [1] "calcGDP"          "calcGDPpc"        "calcPopulation"   "calcLabour"      
    #> [5] "calcUrban"        "calcRatioPPP2MER"

Then there are number of important and/or useful tool functions:

- The function `tooGetUnitDollar()` is where the default unit for all
  monetary units in REMIND and MAgPIE is defined.
- The function `tooGetScenarioDefinition()` is where the scenarios are
  defined and can be helpful when searching for scenario information.
- The functions `toolGeneralConvert()`, `toolHarmonizePast()` and
  `toolHarmonizeFuture()` handle common tasks and are potentially useful
  outside of mrdrivers.

## Scenarios

See `vignette("scenarios")` for more information on - and references
for - available scenarios.

## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("mrdrivers")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```

## Tutorial

The package comes with a vignette describing the basic functionality of the package and how to use it. You can load it with the following command (the package needs to be installed):

```r
vignette("scenarios") # Scenarios
```
